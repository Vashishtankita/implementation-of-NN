# Neural Network - IMPLEMENTATION
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a neural network as part of an academic assignment. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model definition, training, evaluation, and result visualization. 

It is designed to provide insights into the neural network workflow, from dataset preparation to performance assessment.

## Features:
- Neural network construction using [TensorFlow/PyTorch/Other library].
- Dataset preprocessing and visualization.
- Model training with configurable hyperparameters.
- Performance evaluation with metrics and plots.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas .
